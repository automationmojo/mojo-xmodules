        1. During the injectable discovery process, the parameter decorators are executed and the resource
           identifier names and source functions are registered and available for consumption via a query
           interface or by a execution sequencer when generating the injectable execution flow code.

           The source functions and identifiers being registered are stored in the scope tree in
           order to build data structure that allows for the resolution of scope for the parameters
           and associated identifiers that will be consumed by injectables during the execution sequence
           flow. (This is an implicit step)

        2. After all the injectables have been imported and injectable references have been created, we go
           through all of the injectable references and ensure we have a completely filled out scope tree
           for all of the injectables.  As we go we mark scopes as relavant so we can later go back through
           the tree and prune scope nodes that are not relavant to executing a injectable.

        3. Walk through the entire scope tree and prune non-relevant nodes starting at the leaves and
           working backwards until a relavant node is reached or the root of the tree is reached.

        4. Iterate over the injectable references and for each injectable reference, walk through the now
           pruned scope tree utilizing a parameter visibility dictionary chain assigning usages to each
           ParameterOrigin object as a reference is found.  As we walk, we make sure that any parameters
           reference in the current scope are visible in the current parameter dictionary and if not
           store information about the missing parameter.

        5. Go through all of the injectable references and for each injectable reference, collect integration
           and scope couplings that are referenced so we can build a combined picture of everything that
           is being coupled into the execution run.
