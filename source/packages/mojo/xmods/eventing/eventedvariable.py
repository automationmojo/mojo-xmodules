        The EventedVariable object is utilized to handle the storage and propagation
        of event values, updates and timeouts.

        subscription lock because they rely on eventual consistency.  They will
        always contain a value that was good at one point in time and will be
        updated in the future to a value that will be good for a new point in time.

        they are set in the constructor when the object is under the control of only
        a single thread.

        If you need to ensure that the relationship between the value and updated
        members are in sync with each other, then a sync_read and sync_update
        API is provided to ensure this synchronization.
